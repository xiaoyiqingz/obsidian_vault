Register `%` contains the name of the current file.

The following commands could be entered to display the information shown:

```bash
:echo @%                |" directory/name of file
:echo expand('%:t')     |" name of file ('tail')
:echo expand('%:p')     |" full path
:echo expand('%:p:h')   |" directory containing file ('head')
```

If all that is wanted is to display the name of the current file, type `:f`/`:ls` or press `Ctrl-g`  (for full path press `1`  then `Ctrl-g` ).

In insert mode, type  `Ctrl-r`  then  `%`  to insert the name of the current file.

The following commands insert lines consisting of the full path of the current and alternate files into the buffer:

```bash
:put =expand('%:p')
:put =expand('#:p')
```
